<h2>Welcome to the Mass Spectral Match (MSMatch) Application</h3>
<small>A spectral matching application of the Database Infrastructure for Mass Spectrometry (DIMSpec) project.</small>
<h4>This version of MSMatch supports identification of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) by non-targeted analysis (NTA) using high resolution accurate mass spectrometry (HRAMS).</h4>
<p>The goal of this project is to improve access to and utility of analytical data for the confidence dicovery, identification, and source-attribution of PFAS in environmental matrices.</p>
<p>Use of spectral libraries is essential to the success of NTA protocols to identify unknown per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in environmental samples. Current spectral libraries are limited due to the lack of standard data formats and database structures, which limits interoperability between analytical laboratories and even different platforms within laboratories. The main objective of this project is to develop a data analytics infrastructure to contain PFAS mass spectral information and metadata of detected PFAS. With an open database structure, analytical laboratories will be able to include this database in their NTA workflow to identify unknown PFAS.</p>
<p>A common user need addressed by DIMSpec is identification of analytes in a sample measured by high resolution mass spectrometry. Often the components are unknown but may be suspected. Ability to identify not only an analyte from its mass spectra, but to identify known fragments for unknown analytes is a key need; when the analyte itself cannot be identified, non-targeted analysis workflows make use of fragmentation patterns to determine or reconstruct its identity. The MSMatch application was built to accelerate non-targeted analysis projects by searching experimental result data in mzML format for matches against a curated mass spectral library of both compounds and annotated fragments. As with the DIMSpec-QC application, raw data files produced by a mass spectrometer must be converted into mzML format using Proteowizard's msConvert software. There are specific parameters that must be used during conversion.</p>
