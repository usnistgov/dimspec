<h3>Welcome to the NIST database for identification of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) by non-targeted analysis (NTA) using high resolution accurate mass spectrometry (HRAMS).</h3>
<p>The goal of this project is to improve access to and utility of analytical data for the confidence dicovery, identification, and source-attribution of PFAS in environmental matrics.</p>
<p>As part of that, the DIMSpec Quality Control (DIMSpec-QC) application is for the evaluation of mass spectral data for general quality and for the generation of import files that can be directly incorporated into the database. Full usage instructions can be found in the <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/dimspec/docs" target="_blank">DIMSpec User Guide</a>, or in the <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/dimspec/docs/quick_apps.pdf" target="_blank">quick guide for web applications</a>.</p>
<p>In order to use this application, the following must be completed first:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Raw data files must be converted to mzML (<a href="https://pages.nist.gov/dimspec/docs/file_convert.pdf" target="_blank">quick guide</a>; <a href="https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/and-polyfluoroalkyl-substances-pfas/research/reference-data-and-tools/dimspec" target="_blank">video</a>)</li>
  <li>Sample JSON files for each raw data file must be generated, using the <a href="https://github.com/usnistgov/NISTPFAS/blob/main/methodreportingtool/NTA%20Method%20Reporting%20Tool.xlsm" target="_blank">NIST Non-Targeted Analysis Method Reporting Tool</a></li>
