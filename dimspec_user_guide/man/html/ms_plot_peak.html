<h2>Plot a peak from database mass spectral data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Plots the intensity of ion traces over the scan period and annotates them
with the mass to charge value. Several flexible plotting aspects are provided
as data may become complicated.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
ms_plot_peak(
  data,
  peak_type = c("area", "line", "segment"),
  peak_facet_by = "ms_n",
  peak_mz_resolution = 0,
  peak_drop_ratio = 0.01,
  peak_repel_labels = TRUE,
  peak_line_color = "black",
  peak_fill_color = "grey50",
  peak_fill_alpha = 0.2,
  peak_text_size = 3,
  peak_text_offset = 0.02,
  include_method = TRUE,
  db_conn = con
)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>data.frame of spectral data in the form of the 'ms_data' table</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>peak_type</code></td>
<td>
<p>CHR scalar of the plot type to draw, must be one of &quot;line&quot;,
&quot;segment&quot;, or &quot;area&quot; (default: &quot;line&quot;)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>peak_facet_by</code></td>
<td>
<p>CHR scalar name of a column by which to facet the
resulting plot (default: &quot;ms_n&quot;)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>peak_mz_resolution</code></td>
<td>
<p>INT scalar mass to charge ratio tolerance to group
peaks, with at minimum columns for intensity (as &quot;base_int&quot;), ion m/z value
(as &quot;base_ion&quot;), and scan time (as &quot;scantime&quot;) - (default: 0 goes to unit
resolution)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>peak_drop_ratio</code></td>
<td>
<p>NUM scalar threshold of the maximum intensity below
which traces will be dropped (default: 1e-2 means any trace with a maximum
intensity less than 1% of the maximum intensity in the plot will be
dropped); if &gt; 1 the inversion will be used (1e5 -&gt; 1e-5)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>peak_repel_labels</code></td>
<td>
<p>LGL scalar on whether to use the [ggrepel] package
to space out m/z labels in the plot (default: TRUE). If [ggrepel] is not
installed, it will default to FALSE rather than requiring an installation</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>peak_line_color</code></td>
<td>
<p>CHR scalar name of the color to use for the &quot;color&quot;
aesthetic (only a single color is supported; default: &quot;black&quot;)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>peak_fill_color</code></td>
<td>
<p>CHR scalar name of the color to use for the &quot;fill&quot;
aesthetic (only a single color is supported; default: &quot;grey70&quot;)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>peak_text_offset</code></td>
<td>
<p>NUM scalar y-axis offset as a fraction of the maximum
intensity for trace annotation (default: 0.02 offsets labels in the
positive direction by 2% of the maximum intensity)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>db_conn</code></td>
<td>
<p>database connection (default: con) which must be live to pull
sample and compound identification information</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The basic default plot will group all mass-to-charge ratio values by unit
resolution (increase resolution with 'peak_mz_resolution') and plot them as
an area trace over the scanning period. Traces are annotated with the
grouping value. Values of 'peak_mz_resolution' greater than available data
(e.g. 10 when data resolution is to the 5th decimal point) will default to
maximum resolution.
</p>
<p>Traces are filtered out completely if their maximum intensity is below the
ratio set by 'peak_drop_ratio'; only complete traces are filtered out this
way, not individual data points within a retained trace. Set this as the
fraction of the base peak (the peak of maximum intensity) to use to filter
out low-intensity traces. The calculated intensity threshold will be printed
to the caption.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>ggplot object
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Increasing 'peak_mz_resolution' will likely result in multiple separate
traces.
</p>
<p>Implicitly missing values are not interpolated, but lines are drawn
through to the next point.
</p>
<p>'peak_type' can will accept abbreviations of its accepted values (e.g.
&quot;l&quot; for &quot;line&quot;)
